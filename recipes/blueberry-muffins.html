      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        These blueberry muffins are extra large and yummy with a sugary-cinnamon
        crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just
        to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin.
        Add extra blueberries if you want!
      </p>
      <p>
        This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity
        flavor. A buttery streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over
        the top.

        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Crumb Topping:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin
          cups or line with paper liners.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together
          in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to
          reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and
          mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a
          small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top.
          Sprinkle with crumb topping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of
          a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
