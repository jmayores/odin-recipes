      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Peach cobbler is a classic American dessert that typically consists of
        baked peaches topped with a sweet biscuit-like crust. It's a popular
        dessert in the southern United States, especially during the summer
        months when peaches are in season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peach cobbler is typically served warm, either on its own or with a
        scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. It has a
        comforting, homey taste and texture, with the sweetness of the peaches
        complemented by the slightly crunchy and buttery crust. It's a
        delightful dessert that showcases the natural flavors of fresh peaches
        and is enjoyed by many as a comforting and delicious treat.

      <p>The below recipe is actually from my mom's own handwritten recipe.</p>

      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>10 ripe peaches</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup corn starch</li>
        <li>1 tsp grated lemon peel</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a large bowl, mix the above together several times. Let stand for 30
        minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Preheat over to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place butter in a 9x13 inch pan
        and melt in oven while it is preheating.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2/3 cup butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Combine all the above 1st 4 ingredients. Combine butter into the mixture
        using your hands until mixture is a crumble-like texture. Add cream and
        stir just until dough holds together.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mix above ingredients together. Stir in milk.</p>

      <h2>Step 5</h2>
      <p>
        Remove pan of melted butter from over. Pour mixture from Step 4 into pan
        but do not stir. Spread mixture from Step 1 onto batter. Drain mixture
        from Step 1 of excess syrup before spreading on the batter. Crumble
        mixture from Step 3 evenly over fruit.
      </p>
      <p>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 60 minutes.</p>
